Furthermore, runoff from factory farms and livestock grazing is one of the leading causes of pollution in our rivers and lakes. Factory farms even spray liquid manure into the air, creating mists that are carried away by the wind causing people who live nearby inhale the toxins and pathogens from the sprayed manure. Animal agriculture negatively impacts the enviornment in a variety of ways. Therefore, you should carefully consider what you consume and what its impact is on the enviornment. <br>";
