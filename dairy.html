  <p>Milk is an essential part of Americans'  lives. It is vital to choose the right type of milk. According to this BBC graph of the enviornmental imapct of different type of milks, it is clear that dairy milk is detrimental to the earth due to its large carbon emissions, land use, and water use. However, oat milk and soy milk use the least land and water. They also produce significantly less carbon emissions. Therefore, if you want to consume milk ethically, you should choose vegan alternatives.</p>

In order to meet the large demand for milk, cows have to be artificially inseminated to give birth and produce milk. As a result, cows are constantly impregnated to produce six or seven times more than they used to. Cows are also injected with hormones to maximize their milk output. However, once the cows begin to decrease in productivity, they are sold off to the meat industry. Their lives are spent in confinement and treated unethically.<br>";
